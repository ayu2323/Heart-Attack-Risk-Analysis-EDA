# Heart-Attack-Risk-Analysis-EDA
Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors influencing heart attack occurrence.

🎯 Business Problem

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide.
The objective is to identify high-risk patterns to support preventive healthcare decisions.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains patient-level information including:

Demographics (Age, Gender, Region)

Medical history (Hypertension, Diabetes, Obesity)

Lifestyle factors (Smoking, Physical Activity, Diet, Stress)

Target variable: Heart_Attack

 **Analysis Performed**

Univariate Analysis

Bivariate Analysis (Heart_Attack vs key variables)

Correlation Analysis on numeric features

**Key Insights**

Medical history variables such as Hypertension, Diabetes, Obesity, and Previous Heart Attack show strong association with heart attack occurrence.

Lifestyle factors like poor diet and low physical activity act as supporting risk contributors.

Correlation analysis reveals no strong linear relationship among numeric variables, indicating a multifactorial risk pattern.
